# Background

In 2015, Spotify launched its very first “Discover Weekly” playlists to its users and it became an instant hit. Within 6 months of launch, this playlist was streamed over 1.7 billion times, according to the company.

Nowadays, we can see a few more playlists or collections uniquely curated for each user, such as “Trending genres for you”, “Uniquely yours” (collection), “Based on your recent listening”, “More Like [Artist Name]”, and “More of what you like”. Its recommendation system covers not only music but podcasts as well, such as a curated list of “Shows you might like”. At the time of writing, my Spotify homepage has 21 “component positions” vertically, and 8 of them directly indicate music recommendations, such as “More Like [Artist Name]”. And for the rest, nearly all 13 of them have embedded some sort of recommending mechanism into the collections in their positions with the exception of “The state of music today”, which I assume is intended to introduce users to new genres and music, with which the users might discover new music tastes either similar to or unlike what they were used to before.
